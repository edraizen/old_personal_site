  A flexible, Python-based platform for protein structural properties and biophysical data in machine learning. 
  We cleaned domain structure from <b>20 CATH Homologous Superfamilies.</b> Domain structures are cleaned by adding
  missing residues with MODELLER, missing atoms with SCWRL4 [3], and protonating and energy minimizing (simple de-bump) with PDB2PQR [4]. 
  We follow the CATH hierarchy in a hierarchical data format (HDF) file and include atomic level features, residue level features, 
  residue-residue contact, and pre-calculated train (~80%) / test (~10%) / validation (~10%) splits for each superfamily derived from CATH's 
  sequence identity clusters (e.g. S35 for 35% seq ID). The software to reproduce the dataset (Prop3D) is availble on github and the resultant 
  dataset is available as an HSDS instance.

  We hypothesize that there may be a bona fide level/entity that exists in between the Architecture and Topology entities in 
  hierarchies of protein structure space presented by CATH, SCOP, and ECOD, to represent 3D architectural similarity despite 
  topological variability. I developed DeepUrfold, a new tool to explore the protein structure space in hopes of finding new Urfolds. This includes
  1. A sequence-independent, alignment-free, rotation-invariant similarity metric of proteins that leverages similarities in latent-spaces 
  rather than 3D structures (Superfamily-specific Variational Autoencoders); 
  2. A mixed-membership community detection approach to cluster similar protein structures using Stochastic Block Models. 
  This method takes a different approach to clustering, allowing for proteins to span multiple clusters, thereby allowing for the 
  continuous nature of fold space.; and
  3. An Explaining AI approch (LRP) to investigate the SBM communties and define new Urfold-- potentially iscontinuous regions of structure.
