  Hi, I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Virginia in the labs of <a href="http://bournelab.org/">Phil Bourne and Cameron Mura</a>.
  I am interested in structural bioinformatics and machine learning applied to protein evolution and host-pathogen interactions.
  I was previosly an organizer for the <a href="https://iscb-dc-rsg.github.io/">ISCB Region Student Group in DC</a> as the Student Council Symposiums at the main ISCB conference.
